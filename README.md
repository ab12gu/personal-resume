This is my personal resume. I probably should do some software license thing, but I don't know enough about open source licenses yet. However, I don't want to end up like MongDB and chose the wrong license and have others make money of my stuff without paying royalties.... 

I did start my resume back in undergrad when I had very little scope on programming and programming languages. Since, I have made several websites and am very knowledgable in this domain. 

However, its kinda a pita to remake the whole thing... But I've been mentoring a undergraduate student to produce her resume in "web code" - html/css, which I should have done from the beginning ngl...

Anyways assume I made my resume like this:
- https://github.com/carly85/personal-resume

That hyperlink might break because I just told her to update it to meet github pages criteria and unsure if I'll update my readme... so just go to her profile and find it if you really interested on how I code up resumes..........
