After taking a leave to help with family, I am transitioning back into the industry when the right job arises. I am currently working on a custom motor driver using the microcontroller, ESP32, for FRC. 
Most of my other time is occupied with in mentoring college and high school students, volunteering at a bicycle repair coop \& makerspace, and a variety of sports/hobbies.
